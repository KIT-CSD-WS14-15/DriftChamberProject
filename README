This project is set up with the g++ compiler
of version 4.7 or higher.

On Ubuntu you can do the following to get such
a compiler:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade g++

Further you need the google test suite,
which you can get with the following command:

wget https://googletest.googlecode.com/files/gtest-1.7.0.zip

To extract the files, you can use the command 'unzip'
The build system uses scons, which you can add on Ubuntu via:

sudo apt-get install scons

You need to modify some files in gtest, that this works with the
SConstruct provided by this project. Please read for
further instructions the SConstruct.
